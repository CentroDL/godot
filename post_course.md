## Post-Class Workflow

Sadly, we've wrapped up our time together as a class, and thus your learning process going forward will be mostly self-directed. To help focus your time, we've put together this guide on how to best approach your development post-course.

#### Self-Assessment

Your self-assessment is an invaluable tool. Review it on a regular basis and chip away at all the stuff you are even remotely unsure of. Provided you're honest with yourself, it will give you the best measuring stick of your understanding and progress.

#### SCRUM with each other at GA

* Self-organize into groups and agree on a time to meet at GA or elsewhere.
* Spend 5-10 minutes each day to:
  * Review what you accomplished the day before
  * Plan what you are going to tackle that day, however big or small.
  * Identify anything that might be blocking you and figure out what needs to happen to remove those blockers

#### Meetups

Identify common areas of interest (gaming, education, healthcare, et cetera) among your classmates, and use Slack to alert them to meetups you plan on attending. Trust us, it's always easier to go with a group than alone.

#### Keep Building

* refactor and write tests for your projects. Add new features using BDD.
* Fork open source projects on GitHub and submit fixes to issues.
* Make it a goal to open your terminal every day. We've learned an incredible about over the past 3 months, and most likely you're tired. But it is critical that you keep repping because you will forget what you've learned if you don't keep at it. So keep at it.
