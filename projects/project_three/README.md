# Final Project

It's time to go out and build something. As always, project week will be a 
*sprint*, and doesn't end on the final day. Keep that in mind, and keep your 
MVP focused!

Our advice is this:

> Make something:
>
> 1. that you've always wanted to make, or
> 1. something that you feel will reinforce the lessons learned throughout WDI.
>
> Either way, think big, but also describe a very modest set of features for
> your MVP. This way you have a project that you want to continue to work on
> and build after the sprint is over!

## Project Objectives

- Write code you want people to read,
- build something nice and small (not a sprawling mess, but a real **MVP**),
- build something with potential to grow (so that you can continue adding 
  features to it after the course), and
- manage your time well (remember: this is a test-run for your life 
  post-course)!

## Requirements

- __Application__
    - has a public GitHub repo with comprehensive README documentation (see below).
    - follows a style (you can use [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)
      and [jsHint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint), but at least stick to a 
      consistent style and defend it),
    - follows principles of good software:
      - (1) semantic **naming**,
      - (2) **small** procedures and classes,
      - (3) a **DRY** structure (no-repeated code),
      - readable or commented (as necessary), and
    - is deployed.
- __Indidivual__
    - present your work and describe why you created it, eg:
      1. *"It's an area or project of interest to me - this is a proof of 
         concept."*
      1. *"I decided to build this project because I learned about x, y, z in 
         this course, and found those things interesting."*

## Deliverables for Wednesday, March 4th (end of day)

- A single paragraph description of what you want your project to do, or be.
- A Trello board that lists the features as User Stories (*A user can log in.*):
  - **Current** (what you're currently working on)
  - **Sprint** (what you hope to have finished in this sprint, ie your MVP)
  - **Backlog** (your wishlist)

## Deliverables for Tuesday, March 10th (beginning of day)

- An application with documentation that includes:
    - a Trello board with the state of the features
    - a link to the deployed app
    - a short description
    - a list of technologies used (with appropriate links)
    - artifacts:
      - wireframes, and an
      - ERD (if applicable).
- A 5 minute Lightning talk that:
    - demos your application.
