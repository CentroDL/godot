## From Outcomes to Alumni

The graduated students should receive an email with a link back to the Outcomes Tracker to fill out a survey.

Once a student completes the 100 Day survey and states they are "employed" they become an "Alumni"

Until a student becomes an "Alumni" they are considered an "Outcome"
