## Prompts

Each [team](teams.md) will tackle an assigned prompt.  Each application will run as a stand alone service that feeds back into the WDI api.

Each prompt contains a set of criteria with some sample wireframes to serve as guides.  Your team will need to create their own wireframes and flesh out what data you'll track.

Objectives

- Collaborate with your peers as a team
- Pull everything together by building a web application from the ground up.
- Gain experience collaborating and working in a development team.
- Practice integrating topics covered during this course thus far, bridging the gaps between the various areas of a web app (client-side and server-side).
- Use GitHub and Trello to collaborate

## Requirements

- A Ruby on Rails and Postgres Application.
- An external API must be consumed.
- All of your routes should follow REST protocol
- You application must provide authentication.
- Your application MUST be on Heroku.
- Every team member must be involved.
- Adhere to the included [Accessibility Guidelines](accessibility_guidelines.md).

> Consider using pair programming when writing your code. It is great to ensure
> that you are writing good code and to help each team member understand the
> code base as it is being written.

## Deliverables 

- The MVP of an application with a detailed README that features:
    - A short description of your Application
    - Team members names and links to their githubs
    - Technologies used
    - A link to your team's Trello board
    - Artifacts
        - Wireframes
        - ERDs
- A GitHub Organization that includes each member of your team.
- A new Trello board that serves as a prioritized list of tasks your team needs to complete during your sprint. This includes user stories, bug fix, general todo.
A Lightning talk that:
- Demos your application on Heroku.
- Each group will be presenting this talk to the entire class
