# Week 1 - Introduction to Programming

### What did we do last week?

- **Pre-work**: Practiced using our computers, became comfortable with using [*nix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems, and familiarized ourselves with the tools of web development.
- **Orientation**: Learned about WDI and set expectations and policies around our class.
- **'Installfest'**: Created a common development environment for us all to share as we begin learning the fundamentals of programming and using our computers to create software.

### What are we doing [next week](/w02/README.md)?

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: We are going to write our programs in an object-oriented way, with Ruby's robust "[object model](http://www.hokstad.com/ruby-object-model)" of Objects, Classes, Modules, Inheritance and Composition.
- **Behavior-Driven Development**: We will describe the conceptual foundation of object-oriented programming (encapsulation, interfaces, and messages), and introduce ourselves to the concept of behavior-driven development (designing our software by defining interfaces first).
- **Persistent Stores**: We are also going to begin storing data in a persistent way using the Redis database.
