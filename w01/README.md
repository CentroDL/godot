# Week 1 - Introduction to Programming

### What did we do last week?

- **Pre-work**: Practiced using our computers, became comfortable with using [*nix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems, and familiarized ourselves with the tools of web development.
- **Orientation**: Learned about WDI and set expectations and policies around our class.
- **'Installfest'**: Created a common development environment for us all to share as we begin learning the fundamentals of programming and using our computers to create software.

### Supplemental Materials

For this course we will be assigning material when it makes sense. If you ever need supplemental material, we have a list of **[suggested books](https://gist.github.com/h4w5/5bea5c6922695fca96b1)**. You can also find freely available (open source) **[learning materials on GitHub](http://resrc.io)**.

### Suggested Readings for Class

Here is a list of general introductory material for this week about writing Ruby:

- [Chris Pine's Learn to Program, chapters 1-8](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/). Also can be found [here](http://it-ebooks.info/book/36/) if the link is broken...
- [The Pickaxe Book](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/)
- [Why's Poingnant Guide to Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/)
  - *__Phil__ & __PJ__: This is the best computer book ever written. Have fun with it!*
  - *__Travis__: For someone who doesn't know that Why is a character, it can be off-putting. I'm uncomfortable with it.*

- **Methods**
  - another ridiculously in-depth examination from the [Bastard's Book of Ruby](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/methods/)
- **Debugging Code**
  - some last extra thing, again from the [Bastard's Book of Ruby](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/conventions/#h-2-5)
  - [using pry as a debugger](http://yorickpeterse.com/articles/debugging-with-pry/)

### What are we doing [next week](/w02/README.md)?

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: We are going to write our programs in an object-oriented way, with Ruby's robust "object model" of Objects, Classes, Modules, Inheritance and Composition.
- **Behavior-Driven Development**: We will describe the conceptual foundation of object-oriented programming (encapsulation, interfaces, and messages), and introduce ourselves to the concept of behavior-driven development (designing our software by defining interfaces first).
- **Persistent Stores**: We are also going to begin storing data in a persistent way using the Redis database.
