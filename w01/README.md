# Week 1 - Introduction to Programming

### What did we do last week?

- **Pre-work**: Practiced using our computers, became comfortable with using [*nix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems, and familiarized ourselves with the tools of web development.
- **Orientation**: Learned about WDI and set expectations and policies around our class.
- **Installfest**: Created a common development environment for us all to share as we begin learning the fundamentals of programming and using our computers to create software.

- [Debugging with Pry](http://yorickpeterse.com/articles/debugging-with-pry/)
- [Loading Code Libraries](https://practicingruby.com/articles/ways-to-load-code)
- [Chris Pine's Learn to Program, chapters 1-8](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/). Also can be found [here](http://it-ebooks.info/book/36/) if the link is broken...
- [Sublime Text 2 Keyboard Shortcuts](https://gist.github.com/vanderhoop/0356c9489ccba09ffc5a)
- [Lifehacker Mac Terminal Primer](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything)
- [Unix Mages, chapters 1 - 6](http://unixmages.com/ufbm.pdf)
  - a great tool for [exploring how variables work](https://github.com/mattbaker/ruby-heap-viz)!
- **Git & GitHub**
  - [Try Git interactive tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
  - [setting up a repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/)
  - [simple Git guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
  - [*the book* on Git (Pro Git), chapters 1 & 2](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

### What are we doing [next week](/w02/README.md)?

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: We are going to write our programs in an object-oriented way, with Ruby's robust "object model" of Objects, Classes, Modules, Inheritance and Composition.
- **Behavior-Driven Development**: We will describe the conceptual foundation of object-oriented programming (encapsulation, interfaces, and messages), and introduce ourselves to the concept of behavior-driven development (designing our software by defining interfaces first).
- **Persistent Stores**: We are also going to begin storing data in a persistent way using the Redis database.

### Supplemental Materials

For this course we will be assigning material when it makes sense. If you ever need supplemental material, we have a list of **[suggested books](https://gist.github.com/h4w5/5bea5c6922695fca96b1)**.
