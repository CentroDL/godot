## While The Cradle Rocks

In today's "student" directory, write a short Ruby program that tracks all the things Phil does while his son, Jim-Kevin, sleeps.

#### Directions

1. Create a Ruby file, `while_the_cradle_rocks.rb` within today's "student" directory.
1. Within `while_the_cradle_rocks.rb`, create a variable, `jim_kevin_is_sleeping` and assign it the Boolean value of `true`
1. Create a variable, `phils_accomplishments` and assign it an empty string `""`
1. Create a while loop that will run as long as Jim-Kevin is sleeping.
1. As long as Jim-Kevin sleeps, ask Phil what errand he runs. Use string __concatenation__ to add it to the end of the `phils_accomplishments` string, along with a comma and a space, as this should print as a string.
1. Just before the end of the while loop, ask Phil if Jim-Kevin is still sleeping. Depending on her answer, assign `jim_kevin_is_sleeping` to either true or false. 
1. After Jim-Kevin wakes up, print the value of `phils_accomplishments` to the console.

#### Bonus

Make it print in a sensible manner.

__Example:__ `While the Cradle Rocked, Phil built up his knowledge in Ruby, took a nap himself, and went to the corner grocery.`
