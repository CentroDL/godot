## Practice Writing and Invoking Methods

You just learned how to write reusable code in the form of Ruby Methods. Put your knowledge to use.

#### Directions

Continue working in your `helper_methods.rb` file.

1. Define a method, `sing` that takes a single argument as input and prints that argument to the console as if it's being sung (all caps with a bunch of exclamation points added to the end)
  - Call your new `sing` method, passing your favorite lyric as input.
  - On the next line, call your new `sing` method again, passing in the String value, `"Freeze your blood and stab it into me."` (Travis' Favorite Lyric)
1. Define a method, `calculate_generous_tip_amount` which takes a single argument and returns a value equal to 20% of the whatever is passed in as the argument.
  - Call this method with a numeric value of your choosing and save the output to a variable called `lunch_tip_on_dec_4`.
  - On the next line, call this method with a different numeric value and save the output to a variable called `dinner_tip_on_dec_4`.
1. Define a method, `convert_kelvin_to_celcius` which takes a single argument and returns a Float value equal to the argument minus `273.15`.
  - Call this method with a numeric value of your choosing and save the output to a variable called `fav_temp_in_celcius`.
1. Define a method, `calculate_volume` that takes three arguments, and returns the product of those three arguments.
  - Call this method with values of your choosing and save the output to a variable called `volume_of_heaven_in_cubic_feet`.
  - Call this method again but with different arguments, save the output to a sensibly named variable of your choosing.
