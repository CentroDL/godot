# The Battle of Rivverun

![Riverrun](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/thumb/4/4a/Riverrun_by_Feliche.jpg/300px-Riverrun_by_Feliche.jpg)

> Bad news! The forces of House Stark and House Lannister are about to meet in battle and the Lannisters outnumber the Starks! This day could end in disaster!

The exercise is to fix the program in `battle_of_riverrun.rb` so that the Starks win. To do this, you will have to use `require_relative` to load the forces of their allies in the `riverlands` folder, and then update the arithmetic.

Run the program with the command:

```
$ ruby battle_of_riverrun.rb
```

If your allies haven't arrived yet, you'll see **errors**. You must find them and require them!
