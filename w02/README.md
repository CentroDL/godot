# Week 2 - Object-Oriented Programming

### What did we do last week?

- **Our Development Environment**: We used the terminal (or *command-line interface*, CLI) to navigate and manipulate our filesystem, run programs, edit text files, work with I/O (input and output) and configure and interact with our operating system. We also introduced important tools in the terminal like REPLs (`irb` & `pry`), interpreters (`ruby`) and editors (`nano`), as well as in our GUI: window managers (*Spectacle*, eg) and text editors (*Sublime*).
- **Introduction to Programming**: We began the process of solving problems with software, and learning the fundamental structures of procedural programming:  I/O, conditionals, loops, procedures, data types and data structures.
- **Version Control with Git and GitHub**: We familiarized ourselves with the concept of versioning (updating, staging, committing and navigating the history of repositories) using the CLI tool Git. We also began to use the online service GitHub to allow us to share our Git repositories (or *repos*) and collaborate on them.
