# Good Morning!

Take a look at `morning.rb`

**It needs some fixing up!**

Here's the example: 

```
exit unless sing("I stay out too late") == "♬I stay out too late♬"
```

The above line says 

> "Exit the program `unless sing("I say out too late")` returns `"♬I stay out too late♬"`

The `sing` method definition is currently empty so it doesn't return `"♬I stay out too late♬"`. Instead the program exits. 

It's up to you to **write all the missing code** to make the program continue.
