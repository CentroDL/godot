# Morning!

We're going to practice creating classes and using simple assertions!

Take a look at the following "hashlike" table of ScrabbleScores.  How would you turn this into a real hash?

```
  a : 1, b : 3,  c : 3, d : 2, e : 1,
  f : 4, g : 2,  h : 4, i : 1, j : 8,
  k : 5, l : 1,  m : 3, n : 1, o : 1,
  p : 3, q : 10, r : 1, s : 1, t : 1,
  u : 1, v : 4,  w : 4, x : 8, y : 4,
  z : 10
```

> Sublime Tip! 
Did you know you can work with Multiple Cursors in Sublime? 
Hold command and click to add one at a time or option click and drag to select 
a vertical line. Press escape to go back to one cursor.

The assertions are written in `spec/scrabble_word_spec.rb` Try running them with

`ruby spec/scrabble_word.spec`
