# Profile Page

We are going to rewrite your personal profile page to be served by Sinatra and
have dynamic components.

## Part 1 - HTML

Write a simple page that has all of the necessary components, and will serve as
a basic personal profile.

#### Step 1

Create the basic structure of an HTML file, in a folder called `profile`. The
name of the file should be `index.html`. Include a *doctype*, a *head* and a
*body*. Use
[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/tree/master/src)
as an example, if you need it.

**Do not make changes to this file!** You will be pulling updates to it and you
do not want to get merge conflicts!
