# Profile Page

We are going to rewrite your personal profile page to be served by Sinatra and
have dynamic components.

## Part 1 - HTML

Write a simple page that has all of the necessary components, and will serve as
a basic personal profile.

#### Step 1

Create the basic structure of an HTML file, in a folder called `profile`. The
name of the file should be `index.html`. Include a *doctype*, a *head* and a
*body*. Use
[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/tree/master/src)
as an example, if you need it.

### Step 2

Add to your page:

- A page header with a welcome message like "Welcome to my Profile Page"
- A page footer with a "made by" message, like "Made with Love in NYC by H4W5"
- Two divs:
  - One with basic info:
    - an image of yourself (from the internet!),
    - first name,
    - last name,
    - birthdate,
    - home,
    - pet(s) as a **list**,
    - favorite color
  - One with a quick, personal statement

### Step 3

Add to your two divs the classes: `basic-info` and `statement`.

### Step 4

Add links to a new pages entitled "Info Page: Name", subtitled "Info Type,"
that shows the name, the type of info, and the piece of info for the whole basic
info div above.
