Fill in the missing code in `config.ru` and `server.rb`

Create a `Server` class inside a `Portfolio` module
`Server` should inherit from `Sinatra::Base`

Create a `route handler` inside the `Portfolio::Server` class to handle `GET` requests  to `/`

When a client makes a *request* to `localhost:3000` send back a *response* with 
a `status code` of 200, in the `headers` include the key-value pair "X-Powered-By: Sinatra" and the text "<h1>Good Morning</h1>" in the `body` of the 
*response*

Start your server with the `rackup` command listening on port 3000.
