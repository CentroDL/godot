## Anagram Code Challenge

[According to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram), any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram. For example, "santa" is an anagram of "satan", and "silent" is an anagram of "listen". Your task: to create an anagram checking program for a test-crazy anagram enthusiast. Directions below.

#### Directions

1. Run the specs in `spec/anagram_spec.rb`.
1. Make the specs for the `anagram?` method pass by writing your code in `lib/anagram.rb`
1. Once your `anagram?` method cuts the mustard, use it to make the specs for `find_anagrams` pass.

#### Bonus

Anagrams can also be made up of multiple words. For example, "Mr Mojo Risin" is a valid anagram of "Jim Morrison". Write additional specs to test this, then write the code to make them pass.
