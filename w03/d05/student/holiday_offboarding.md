## Holiday Break

You've worked incredibly hard for the last 3 weeks, and learned [an incredible amount](learning_objectives_covered_through_week_3.md). In parting for the holiday, it's important that you practice and review what you've learned. Additionally, we'll be assigning small readings and exercises on HTML/CSS daily beginning Monday, Dec 22nd. These will be focused on HTML/CSS. 

#### How to Go About Reviewing The Work We've Done

1. Continue working in the terminal.
  - You've built up a lot of muscle memory for working with terminal. Don't lose it all over the break by reverting to using Finder.
1. Revisit the assignments that gave you trouble over the first 3 weeks.
  - We assign the homework and exercises we do because they prepare you to build web applications, and the rest of the course will be focused on building web applications. That said, the best way that you can prepare yourself for the rest of the course is to revisit the exercises and homeworks assigned thus far. 
1. If you cannot complete a particular exercise, check out the exercise's solution, posted in the `instructor` directory of the same day.
  - comment the solution line by line, explaining what the code does in your own words. If you don't understand a particular bit of syntax, look it up on Stack Overflow and the Ruby Docs. If those don't yield results, keep searching until you find somewhere that does.

__Average review time for topics covered thus far:__ ~45 minutes/day

#### How to Go About the Self-Directed HTML/CSS Work

The HTML/CSS readings and exercises are meant to help you avoid a number of the headaches associated with learning CSS. (There are tons.) They scaffold in a meaningful way, so progress from one to the next in the order they are given.

__Average review time for CSS readings and exercises:__ ~ 1.5 hours/day
