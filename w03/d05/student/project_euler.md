## Project Euler

What is [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)?

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that allows you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem.

#### Exercise Objectives
- build problem solving muscle
- gain public activity on GitHub

#### Directions

1. [Create an account at Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/register).
1. Create a directory called `project_euler` __outside of your `godot` directory__.
1. cd into your `project_euler` directory and initialize it as a git repo via `git init`
1. Use `hub create` to create a remote repo on GitHub.
1. Within your repo, create a file `question_01.rb` and [solve this problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1).
1. Submit your answer to Project Euler. If it's correct, move on to the next problem.
If it isn't, keep trying.
