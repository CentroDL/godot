## Operation

[Operation!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_%28game%29) is a boardgame that requires players to carefully replace the missing organs of a man with a strange diet. You've been tasked with doing the exact same thing, but using CSS.

#### Directions

1. Open up the [index.html](index.html) file in Chrome. Take a look at the layout.
1. Alter the css within [css/style.css](css/style.css), using a combination of `position` + `top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left` attributes to position the patient's heart, wishbone, bread, and butterfly in the appropriate slots.
  - __Note:__ for the attributes above to have any effect, you'll first have to set the elements' `position` attribute. 

#### Potential Hiccups

- The `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` properties won't have any effect on statically positioned elements, and all elements have a position of `static` by default. So for them to have any effect, you'll first have to change the element's `position`.
