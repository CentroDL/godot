## The Display Sandbox

List items and divs are both block level elements by default. But you can change that with CSS to lay them out in rows, which is exactly what you're going to do.

#### Exercise Objectives

- get meaningful experience using `display: inline-block` to lay typically block-level elements out in a row

#### Directions

1. Take a look at the elements in [`index.html`](index.html). Notice that they are all block elements.
1. Alter [`stylesheets/style.css`](stylesheets/style.css) to update the layout in the following ways: 
  - Set the list items `display` property to `inline-block`. Save your work and examine the difference in the layout.
  - Set the divs' `display` property to `inline-block`. Save your work and examine the difference in the layout.
