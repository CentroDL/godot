## CSS Day 6: Layouts

Welcome to Day 6 of your Holiday Work. Today's work focuses on breaking down a design. The work below assumes you have done the all the work from days 1-5, so revisit that work before moving on.

#### Part 1: Thinking About Layout

Often, a designer will hand off a photoshop (psd) file with countless layers, and you'll be expected to recreate it with HTML/CSS. But where to start? Different developers have different approaches, but you can't go wrong by combining the two guideless below:

1. Before coding a thing, break the layout down into its component parts.
  - Where are the *rows* in the layout?
  - Where are the *columns* in the layout?
  - How the rows and columns nested?
1. Move from the outside in, focusing on the *layout* of the elements and avoiding the urge to add text and color stylings (they prematurely clutter your stylesheets and thus your mind)
  - Examine your layout and code the *outermost* element first.
    - For example, if all of the design's content resides in a centered container, make sure you *have* a centered container before moving inward.
  - Move inward, coding the first nested element that your layout requires. 
  - Methodically repeat this process until you have your layout in order.

  #### Part 2: Lars Tornoe

  Complete [the Lars Tornoe exercise](lars_tornoe), which requires you to mindfully nest divs in an arrangement of rows and columns. Pay special attention to the [layout breakdown](lars_tornoe/layout_breakdown.png) provided.
