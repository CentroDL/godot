## CSS Day 6: Layouts

Welcome to Day 6 of your Holiday Work. Today's work focuses on breaking down a design. The work below assumes you have done the all the work from days 1-5, so revisit that work before moving on.

#### Part 1: Thinking About Layout

Often, a designer will hand you a photoshop (psd) file with countless layers, and you'll be expected to recreate it with HTML/CSS. But where to start? Different developers have different approaches, but you can't go wrong by combining the two guidelines below:

1. Before coding a thing, break the layout down into its component parts.
  - Where are the *rows* in the layout?
  - Where are the *columns* in the layout?
  - How the rows and columns nested?
1. Code the outermost elements first, and work your way in.
  - Examine your layout and code the *outermost* element first.
    - For example, if all of the design's content resides in a centered container, make sure you *have* a centered container before moving inward.
1. Get the *layout* of elements in place before moving on to the actual styling of elements.
  - Why? Because font, shadow, and color declarations can prematurely clutter your stylesheets and thus make layout a more frustrating process.
