## CSS Day 7: Layouts

Welcome to Day 7 of your Holiday Work. Today's work again focuses on breaking down a design, but unlike the work from day 6, you will not be provided with a layout breakdown by your manager. The work below assumes you have done the all the work from days 1-6.

#### Part 1: Revisiting Some Helpful Guidelines

Reinforce the CSS layout guidelines from yesterday:

1. Before coding a thing, break the layout down into its component parts.
  - Where are the rows in the layout?
  - Where are the columns in the layout?
  - How are they nested?
1. Code the outermost elements first, and work your way in.
1. Get the *layout* of elements in place before moving on to the actual styling of elements.

#### Part 2: Erik Iggmark's Portfolio
