## Erik Iggmark Portfolio Layout

Here's [a clean, beautiful website](http://www.erikiggmark.se/). You've been tasked with rebuilding it.

#### Exercise Objectives

- get meaningful practice breaking down a layout
- get meaningful practice using `display:inline-block` to lay block-level elements out in rows
- bring in a webfont ('Open Sans') via Google Fonts

#### Directions

1. Take a look at the [live site](http://www.erikiggmark.se/). Get a feel for all the elements on the page.
1. Examine the image files. These will be the only assets provided. With them, you will recreate the layout below.
1. Read up on how to bring in a [Google Web Font](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started). Then bring it in.
1. Use just the subtlest trace of `border-radius` around `img` tags.
