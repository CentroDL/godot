## Erik Iggmark Portfolio Layout

Here's [a clean, beautiful website](http://www.erikiggmark.se/). You've been tasked with rebuilding it.

#### Exercise Objectives

- get meaningful practice breaking down a layout
- get meaningful practice using `display:inline-block` to lay block-level elements out in rows
- bring in a webfont ('Open Sans') via Google Fonts

#### Directions

1. Take a look at the [live site](http://www.erikiggmark.se/).
  - Where are the rows in the layout?
  - Where are the columns in the layout?
  - How are they nested?
1. Code up the layout.
1. Read up on how to bring in a [Google Web Font](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started). Then bring it in.
1. Use just the subtlest trace of `border-radius` around `img` tags.
