## Steve Zeidner Portfolio

Here's a simple portfolio page that makes use of a sticky header. You've been tasked with recreating it.

#### Exercise Objectives

- get additional practice breaking down a layout into its component parts
- implement a sticky header
- practice self-directed learning

#### Directions

1. Take a look at [the live site](http://stevezeidner.com/). Notice the manner in which the header stays put as you scroll down the page.
1. Break down the layout into its component parts
  - Where are the rows in the layout?
  - Where are the columns?
  - How are they nested?
1. Implement the sticky header.
1. Once the sticky header is implemented, code up the rest of the layout. 
  - __Note:__ Read [this article](http://css-tricks.com/absolute-positioning-inside-relative-positioning/) for ideas on how you can overlay Steve's image with text.
  - __Additional Note:__ two of the elements on Steve's website are dynamic: the tweet bubble and miles run graphic. I've provided static photos of these, though they may be out of date.
