# Week 4

### What did we do last week?

It was **Winter "_Break_"**! We worked on HTML and CSS, creating real-world pages based on mockups. Prior to that was **[Week 03](/w03/README.md)**:

- **Understanding Networking (HTTP)**: We will learn about how computers communicate with one another over networks. We will see how that communication is very complicated to perform, but that the complexity is abstracted away from both end users and programmers by using a protocol stack (TCP/IP). We will also discuss the very common *application layer* to that stack, known as Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP, and how it is the basis for the World Wide Web (WWW) and "web" applications. We will interact with other computers via plain HTTP as well.
- **Introduction to the Web as an Application Platform (Sinatra)**: We will build our first programs that interact over the web with end users and their browser clients. These applications will accept GET and POST requests, persist data, and serve HTML & CSS to browsers. We will use a simple Rack-based framework known as Sinatra to structure our "apps."
