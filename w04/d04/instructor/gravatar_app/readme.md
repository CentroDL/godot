## Getting set up with Gravatar

An "avatar" is an image that represents you onlineâ€”a little picture that appears next to your name when you interact with websites.

A Gravatar is a Globally Recognized Avatar. You upload it and create your profile just once, and then when you participate in any Gravatar-enabled site, your Gravatar image will automatically follow you there.

Gravatar is a free service for site owners, developers, and users. It is automatically included in every WordPress.com account and is run and supported by Automattic.

Sign up for a profile on [gravatar.com](https://en.gravatar.com/)

Upload an image to your account and be sure to confirm it as your primary photo.
