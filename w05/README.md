# Week 5

### What did we do [last week](/w04/README.md)?

- **Creating Web Applications (Sinatra)**: We will introduce the idea of CRUD, or the basic structural relationship users have to data on a web application. We will practice building sample applications the allow the user to generate new, specific content, and share it. We will also cover deploying this application to a production server.
- **Persistent Stores (Redis)**: We will learn how to use a simple, No-SQL database (in this case, a key-value store). We will cover both writing to, and reading from, the database in environments such as the command-line interface, simple Ruby programs, and web-based applications. We will also cover how to set up and deploy databases to production servers.

### Suggested Readings and Examples

Here is a list of readings, tutorials, and examples for this week's lessons:

- **Authorization**
  + [Authentication, authorization, and encryption](http://www.bu.edu/tech/services/security/resources/bestpractice/auth/)
  + [What is a session](http://machinesaredigging.com/2013/10/29/how-does-a-web-session-work/)
  + [Rack sessions in Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/faq.html#sessions)
- **OAuth**
  + [Intro to OAuth (in Plain English)](http://blog.varonis.com/introduction-to-oauth/)
  + [OAuth Bible (we are using OAuth 2, three-legged); reference and terms](http://oauthbible.com/)
  + [OmniAuth (OAuth) 2.0 Homepage](http://oauth.net/2/)
  + [Sinatra OAuth, using the OAuth2 Gem](http://blog.gazler.com/blog/2012/01/11/oauth2-consumer-with-sinatra/)
- **DELETE**
  + [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)
  + [Method overriding and forms in Sinatra](http://mikeebert.tumblr.com/post/26877173686/quick-tip-using-put-and-delete-in-sinatra)

### What are we doing next week?

- **JavaScript**: We will learn a new language, JavaScript. JavaScript introduces a few new ideas that are often related to the Functional Programming paradigm, a different *object model* (Prototypes instead of Classes), and slightly different scope and data-typing rules. JavaScript is embedded in every web browser, and is therefore the language of choice for client-side scripting (programming) in web applications.
