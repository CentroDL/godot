# Dear Diary

> Who do you tell your secrets to? Your stuffed animals, your cats, another
> human who has earned your trust? Since I have none of these, I keep them
> inside my diary!

## Setup (Part 0)

Write a class `Diary` that has the following methods:

- `tell_secret(person, secret)` adds a secret to a person's secret list
- `get_secrets(person)` returns a list of secrets for the person

## Part 1

Write a terminal front-end (`require`ing your `Diary` class) that does the
following:

1. Ask if you want to write in your diary or read your diary.
1. Ask who you are.
1. Performs an action:
  - if you want to write, then prompts you to write an entry,
  - if you want to read, then prints out the entries you have written.

## Part 2

Ensure that your diary is persistent, and works whenever you run your program!

## Part 3

Add a password to your diary...

> How would you do it? Why would you do it? What does it protect? What does it
> not protect?
