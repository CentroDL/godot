# Week 6

### What did we do [last week](/w05/README.md)?

- **Authorization**: We introduced the concept of Authorization and Authentication in public-facing applications. Special attention was paid to the *stateless* nature of HTTP, and methods for overcoming that.
- **First Project Sprint**: We had unstructured time devoted to creating a web application!

#### Crockford on JavaScript

Finally, if you are interested, here are additional lectures about the JavaScript

### What are we doing next week?

- **Using JavaScript Libraries**: We will see how to include libraries (code
  other people have written) in to our JavaScript. This is a very different
  process in the browser that follows its own, unique, rules. We will also
  introduce key JavaScript libraries.
- **jQuery**: We will begin to use the most important and famous JavaScript
  library, jQuery. jQuery provides a number of utilities, most importantly
  a simple, cross-browser wrapper for interacting with the DOM and performing
  basic animations.
