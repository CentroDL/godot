# Week 6

### What did we do [last week](/w05/README.md)?

- **Authorization**: We will introduce the concept of Authorization and Authentication in public-facing applications. Special attention will be paid to the *stateless* nature of HTTP, and methods for overcoming that.
- **First Project Sprint**: We will have unstructured time devoted to creating a web application!

### What are we doing this week?

Due to MLK Day, we have a shortened week.

### Suggested Readings and Examples

Here is a list of readings, tutorials, and examples for this week's lessons:

- **JavaScript**
- **The Browser Environment and DOM API**

### What are we doing next week?

- **JavaScript**: We will learn a new language, JavaScript. JavaScript introduces a few new ideas that are often related to the Functional Programming paradigm, a different *object model* (Prototypes instead of Classes), and slightly different scope and data-typing rules. JavaScript is embedded in every web browser, and is therefore the language of choice for client-side scripting (programming) in web applications.
- **Using JavaScript Libraries**: We will see how to include libraries (code
  other people have written) in to our JavaScript. This is a very different
  process in the browser that follows its own, unique, rules. We will also
  introduce key JavaScript libraries.
- **jQuery**: We will begin to use the most important and famous JavaScript
  library, jQuery. jQuery provides a number of utilities, most importantly
  a simple, cross-browser wrapper for interacting with the DOM and performing
  basic animations.
