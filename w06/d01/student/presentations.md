# First Project Sprint Retro

## Outline

The day will be split in to two halves:

- **Code Reviews** (9:00am-12:30pm): We will do small group code reviews, where 
  we critique one another's code and suggest improvements. We will also see how 
  each person organizes their application, comments it, and thinks about how to 
  solve problems.
- **Presentations** (1:30-4:30pm): We will present some of the code we are proud
  about, or that worked out well. We get to see how one another solved certain 
  problems, and can ask questions about why it happenned. 

At 4:30pm we have Outcomes!

## Code Reviews

The purpose of a code review is to:

1. share code our code and educate others while learning how to improve code,
1. become more comfortable with reading one another's code, and understand that
   code is meant to be read by others (issues such as legibility are important, 
   for example),
1. discover if our code is easily understood,
1. make our code better, and to identify common patterns and anti-patterns, and
1. adhere to a common style with our group or teammates.

#### Groups

For code reviews we will break in to small groups:

| Instructor |   Room   | Small Group |
|:----------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
|  Phil  |  Classroom   | Andres Valencia, Brian Rucker, Chadd Clairmont,<br>Kamari Aykes, Melodie Malfa, Aliya Scribner |
| Travis |  Reed (4 Fl) | Dennis Liaw, Kristen MacFarlane, Patricio Calderon,<br>Sade Stevens, Simons Chase  |
|   PJ   | Sagan (4 Fl) | Angelina Bethoney, Dain Carver, Dana DeFilippo,<br>Michael Campbell, Sarah McAlear |

#### Prepare Your Code

Take 10 minutes to prepare your app's code to be reviewed.

Have available for the review:

1. the git repo, at the most recent commit, with no uncommited changes,
1. the git repo should be on a branch called "code_review",
1. the application open in Sublime to the `server.rb` file,
1. a terminal open to the application's root,
1. a terminal running the application with its log,
1. Chrome open at localhost, and
1. nothing else open on the computer!

#### Review Code!

For each member of the team, 30 minutes will be dedicated to the code review.

## Presentations

Everyone must show a 5 minute presentation. If possible, they should demo their working app. If their app is not a working MVP, they should focus on one of the following features:

- CRUD with Redis
- OAuth Login
- API Integration
- Library (Gem) Use
- Design and Style
