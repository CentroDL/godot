## jQuery Snow Day!

We aren't convening for class today, but that doesn't mean you can't learn some sweet, sweet jQuery.

#### Directions 

1. Read through [this excellent intro to jQuery tutorial](http://www.impressivewebs.com/jquery-tutorial-for-beginners/).
2. Reread the tutorial, experimenting with the concepts in the Chrome JavaScript console (They have jQuery loaded on the page!).
3. Complete [The Terminator](the_terminator_jquery) exercise, this time using jQuery.
