# Week 7 - A Week of Sweet Libs

### What did we do [last week](/w06/README.md)?

- **JavaScript**: We learned a new language, JavaScript. JavaScript
introduced a few new ideas that are often related to the Functional
Programming paradigm, a different *object model* (Prototypes instead of
Classes), and slightly different scope and data-typing rules.

### What are we doing [next week](/w07/README.md)?

- **Modeling Domains and Data**: We take a look at how to think about real-world
  situations and problems (also known as *domains*) and turn them in to raw
  data, a process we call domain modeling. We also look at how one takes raw 
  data or other forms of detailed descriptions and turn them into *data models*,
  or highly-structured formats (key-value data, cartesian or tabular data, and
  relational data) with technological solutions for working with them.
- **Using SQL and ORMs (ActiveRecord)**: We learn the most important format for 
  complicated application datasets today (relational data), and the language for
  working with relational data: SQL. We begin using a relational database 
  manager, Postgres. We also explore the Object-Oriented design pattern and Ruby
  library *Active Record*, which eases integration of application behavior and
  relational data stores.
