# Week 08

### What did we do [last week](/w07/README.md)?

- **Using JavaScript Libraries**: We will see how to include libraries (code
  other people have written) in to our JavaScript. This is a very different
  process in the browser that follows its own, unique, rules. We will also
  introduce key JavaScript libraries.
- **jQuery**: We will begin to use the most important and famous JavaScript
  library, jQuery. jQuery provides a number of utilities, most importantly
  a simple, cross-browser wrapper for interacting with the DOM and performing
  basic animations.
