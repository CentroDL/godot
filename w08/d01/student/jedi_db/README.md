#### Setup:

- Enter the postgres console and create a database called `jedi_db`
- Quit the postgres console, __cd into your "jedi_db" directory__, and enter the following line in the terminal:
  - `psql -d jedi_db -f jedis.sql`
  - __NOTE:__ You will have to be within your `jedi_db` directory.

- Great, now head back into the postgres console and connect to `jedi_db`. You should have a table called `jedis`. Take a look at the jedis therein.
