# Week 09

### What did we do [last week](/w08/README.md)?

- **Modeling Domains and Data**: We took a look at how to think about real-world
  situations and problems (also known as *domains*) and turn them in to raw
  data, a process we call domain modeling.
- **Using SQL and ORMs (ActiveRecord)**: We learedn the most important format for 
  complicated application datasets today (relational data), and the language for
  working with relational data: SQL. We began using a relational database 
  manager, Postgres. We also explored the Object-Oriented design pattern *Active Record*, which eases integration of application behavior and relational data stores.
