# RESTful Routes

Describe each of the following real-world interactions with a website according
to the class taxonomy (ACTION and RESOURCE). The possible actions are:
`NEW`, `CREATE`, `SHOW`, `INDEX`, `EDIT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`. Sometimes you will
be given an action or a resource with the description, sometimes neither.

For example:

"Friend" someone, via Facebook, that you just spoke to on the bus. (`CREATE friend(s)`)
