## Validating Credit Card Numbers

Credit card numbers can be validated by reverse engineering the [Luhn algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm). Simply stated, the validation works like this:

1. Starting with the next to last digit of the card number and continuing with *every other digit* going back to the beginning, double the digit.

2. Sum all of the *digits* in the resulting number.

3. If the resulting sum is a multiple of 10, the number is valid.

__Example, given the card number 4408 0412 3456 7893:__

```ruby
# Orig  :  4 4 0 8 0 4 1 2 3 4   5 6   7 8   9 3
# Step 1:  8 4 0 8 0 4 2 2 6 4  10 6  14 8  18 3
# Step 2:  8+4+0+8+0+4+2+2+6+4+1+0+6+1+4+8+1+8+3 = 70
# Step 3:  70 % 10 == 0

# NOTE: In step 1, we double the second to last digit and get 18, but in Step 2 we add the *digits* 1 and 8.
```

#### Directions

1. From within the `luhn_algorithm` directory, run the provided tests using the `rspec` command.
2. Within [`lib/luhn.rb`](lib/luhn.rb), define a class `Luhn`. Provide `Luhn` with a class method `valid?` that takes an integer and returns either true or false, depending on whether the number is valid according to the algorithm. 
3. You'll know you hit the nail on the head when all the tests are green :)

For your reference:
* 1234567890123456 is not valid
* 4408041234567893 is valid
* 38520000023237 is valid
* 4222222222222 is valid
