## Stop Watch

We've been tasked with building out the behavior for a digital stopwatch, the interface for which has been provided in [`index.html`](index.html). 

#### Exercise Objectives
- get additional practice working with JavaScript event listeners
- get additional practice working with JavaScript timers
- get additional practice manipulating the DOM with jQuery

#### Client Specs

- When "Start" is clicked, the text "Stop Watch" should be replaced by "Time elapsed: 0", and the count should increment every second.
- When "Reset" is clicked, the text should return to "Stop Watch"
- When "Pause" is clicked, the text should stop incrementing.

#### Bonus

- As it stands, if you press the start button multiple times, the stop watch incremements like crazy. Fix it so that it behaves like a proper stop watch.
