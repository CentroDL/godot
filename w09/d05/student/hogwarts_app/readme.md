# OH NO!

Hogwarts has lost all its magic and now NOTHING WORKS!

As a member of Dumbledore's Army it's up to YOU to correct all the errors so that this app runs properly.

> Reparo!

## Setup

Start by creating a database and running `rake db:seed`.

Then run `rails s` and correct all the errors as you go along.

When you can display all the houses and students and view their pictures you'll know things are working properly.

## Bonus

Add functionality so students can enroll at Hogwarts (with a link to create a new student). You should implement a sorting hat method so that when a new student is created they are randomly assigned to one of Hogwarts' four houses. (Where do you think this logic should go?)
