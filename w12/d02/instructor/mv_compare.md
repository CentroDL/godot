## MV-Compare

To avoid jQuery spaghetti, the web development community has created a number of libraries and frameworks that help structure your single-page applications. Each has its strengths and weaknesses. 

#### Libraries and Frameworks

- A **library** performs specific, well-defined operations. It does not enforce a workflow for developing applications.
    - examples of client-side libraries: 
      - underscore.js
      - backbone.js
      - moment.js

- A **framework** is a skeleton over which an application's business logic is fleshed out. The skeleton provides core support for the application's specific operations. Frameworks generally have a prescriptive workflow that developers follow.
    - examples of client-side frameworks:
      - ember.js
      - angular.js

#### Research facts:

- **Short description of the tool**
- **Who made it?** (if available)
- **Pattern** (MVC? V-only? etc.)
- **Dependencies** (other libraries this tool depends on)
- **Library or Framework?**
- **Minified filesize** (NOT g-zipped! Download the minified script and âŒ˜I it)
- **Browser Support** (if available)
- **GitHub Commits** (rounded to the nearest hundred)
- **Commits per Kilobyte** (number of commits / minified kilobytes)
- **GitHub Stars** (rounded to the nearest hundred)
